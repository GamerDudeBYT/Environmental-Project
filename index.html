			<h2>What the tracker does</h2>
			<p>
				We have created an eco‚Äìfriendly website which helps lots of people get out of the house and do tasks
				which help the environment. For example, we have created tasks that are various levels which give you a
				certain number of points. This encourages a lot of people to be eco-friendly and respecting the
				environment.

				The eco tracker website where you get set tasks at your own pace and get encouraged to complete them by
				earning points for completing tasks. You get more points for harder tasks. Tasks can be rejected if you
				want and
				you can have any amount of tasks at any time. You can choose what level tasks you get set. It saves
				locally by
				using website cookies.

				We have created an eco tracker website which helps you help the environment. You can set yourself tasks
				at 3 different levels with harder ones giving you more points. Our aim is to encourage you and give you
				motivation to help and respect the environment. You can reject tasks with no negative effects. There is
				no limit to how many tasks you have. You are in control of how environmentally active you want to be, so
				do not worry about time limits and having to keep up as not everyone has lots of free time. If you go
				inactive for more than a year your data is reset as we assume you are not using the website anymore.

				The tasks have 3 levels of difficulty:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="task_easy text">Easy: 100 Points</li>
				<li class="task_medium text">Medium: 200 Points</li>
				<li class="task_hard text">Hard: 300 Points</li>
			</ul>
